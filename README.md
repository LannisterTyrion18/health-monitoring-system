# health-monitoring-system

This is a project which uses the MAX30100 sensor, the Dht11 sensor, OLED sensor and ESp8266 microcontroller to publish data on the cloud about your Heart rate, Sp02,
temperature and humidity as well as on the oled screen. This can be also seen on your phone for which I have created an app using BLYNK.
